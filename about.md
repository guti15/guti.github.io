<p> <b> “When I hear somebody sigh, Life is hard, I am always tempted to ask, ‘Compared to what?'” – Sydney Harris</b>  </p>

<p>Love the challenge in life, hence my transition to become a 'hacker'.  Love puzzle, love socializing, and engiering new ways to fix a problem.  I enjoy life from diffrent view points.  Life is dynamic, and can not be viewed from a fixed point.
Currently working as an Operation Engineer @ Veracode.  The enviorment at my workspace is marvelous! As a company in the cyber security field, conducting <i>Static Analysis</i>, and other forms of security I'm really blessed to work with people short of genuis, from social engineering to traditinal software engineering,
